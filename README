            Portfolio of Kurt Behnke's Programs

************************************************************

This git repository contains a number of programs created by
Kurt Behnke as a sample of his programming output.

Many of the programs here were timed challenges and so are
rudimentary creations intended to roughly solve the given
problem.  As such, they do not have all necessary error
checking which would be needed to implement a robust
solution (implementation) of the requested assignment.
